/// ## Classification
///
/// Particles are divided into two families:
///
/// Family    | Spin              | Characterization                                                                                                                        |
/// --------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
/// Boson     | s ∈ ℤ × *ħ*       | **Bose–Einstein distribution**: there can be an integer multiple of *nQ* number of particles in a concentration per unit of its volume. |
/// Fermion   | s ∈ (ℤ + ½) × *ħ* | **Pauli exclusion**: identical particles of such family cannot have equal quantum states in the same spacetime.                         |

  ///
  /// ## Partiality
  ///
  /// This method returning `true` does not necessarily denote that both ``ParticleLike``s are
  /// equal; rather, as the name implies, the existing equality is partial, meaning that properties
  /// that are specific to either `Self` or the type of `other` may differ and, therefore, still
  /// differentiate them from one another.
  ///
  /// Some ``ParticleLike``s might resort to their type-specific equality comparison, falling back
  /// to the partial comparison in case the first deems their structure different (e.g., an
  /// `Equatable` ``ParticleLike`` initially tests `self == other`; if `false`, then the partial
  /// comparison is performed).
  ///
  /// ## Implicit contract with `Equatable` ``ParticleLike``s
  ///
  /// Comparing two ``ParticleLike``s of the same type which conform to the `Equatable` protocol by
  /// calling this method should always return `true` when `self == other`. However, because of the
  /// aforementioned considerations on partiality, `isPartiallyEqual(to: other) && self == other`
  /// may be `false`.
  ///
  /// - Parameter other: ``ParticleLike`` to which this one will be compared.
  /// - Returns: `true` if the properties shared by these ``ParticleLike`` values are equal;
  ///   otherwise, `false`.
